This repo contains two projects that were requirements for the graduate level "AI Planning" course offered at University of Maryland College Park during spring 2018. Both projects were implemented in Python3.6.

### Contents
* Project1:  Comparing the Fast-Forward heuristic with domain-specific heuristics for solving racetrack problems.
* Project2:  Planning and Acting on racetrack problems with unreliable steering. Two planning algorithms used in this project are Monte Carlo tree search and LAO*.
